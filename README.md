# Encryption-Project
# XOR Encryption and Decryption
This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates AES encryption and decryption using a Command Line Interface (CLI) with a simple menu.

Features

-Encrypts plaintext using AES algorithm and a provided key

-Decrypts ciphertext using the same key

-Supports input from the user via CLI

-Converts plaintext to binary for encryption

-Converts ciphertext back to ASCII for decryption

-Performs bitwise XOR operation for encryption and decryption

# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates Caesar cipher encryption and decryption using a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Features

-Encrypts text files using a Caesar cipher with a provided key

-Decrypts text files using the same key

-Supports input from the user via CLI

-Handles both lowercase and uppercase letters

-Allows the user to specify the input file, output file for encryption, output file for decryption, and the encryption/decryption key via command line arguments
